# Streamlit-app

This is the first time I am using Streamlit library to build a web application for my ML Model. It is very easy to use and there are a lot of functionalities which make ur app look beautiful.

For my project, I wanted to predict sales based on investments made by the marketing team. Here for starters, I have taken only 3 variables.

    TV expenditure
    Newspaper expenditure
    Radio Expenditure

Based on these investments, we need to predict how much sales the company will make.

**Data**
The "Advertisement" dataset can be used for training and testing purpose and "Validation" data can be used to make predictions.

**Code**
There are 2 files attached.

1) "linearregression": This app I have created for training and testing the model.
2) "modelprediction": This app is used for making predictions on unseen data.

**Tools used**

    Python Programming
    Streamlit for Web Application
    plotly for EDA
    If you want you can deploy it on share.streamlit or on Heroku

Requirements.txt file is also attached. So, before beginning if you want you can install these libraries using below command.

    pip install -r requirements.txt
